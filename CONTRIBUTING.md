# Contributing

This repository does not accept external contributions. All code changes are authored by AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, Crush) operating under human direction.

## No External Contributions

This is a single-maintainer project. The CI/CD pipeline, agent review system, and security model are designed around autonomous agent authorship with human oversight. Accepting external PRs would break assumptions the tooling is built on.

## No Feature Requests or Support

Feature requests, guidance, consulting, and support are not provided. This policy is not negotiable.

## What You Can Do

- **Fork it.** Clone the repo and adapt it however you want. This is the recommended path if you need features that don't exist here.
- **Study it.** The codebase demonstrates edition 2024 Rust on PSP, safety hardening for `no_std` targets, and containerized CI/CD for embedded platforms.
- **Use it.** You are free to use any component under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).

You do so entirely at your own risk and without any expectation of support, maintenance, or acknowledgment from the maintainer.
